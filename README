#create six vertices star inside any given quadrature#

##Methodology##

1)frist use 50,75,25 off-set value for input coordinates to ensure generated secondary quadrature vertices inside the user input quadrature.By considering secondary quadrature,
2)Select two edges and divide each of them in to equal three piece by finding two coordinate points on edge.
3)Then 0ther two edges selected and divide each edge in-to two piece by finding intersecting point coordinates of each line.
4)Thereafter, i have six different point coordinates inside user given quadrature.
5)Then using those six points with proper order and "crate_line()" function, draw the six vertices star.

#Now connect six point using straight lines.(In order to make two triangles.)
